# Delivery Performance Analysis 

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a comprehensive food delivery dataset to extract valuable insights on delivery performance, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. Using SQL, various key aspects such as delivery ratings, delivery times, vehicle conditions, traffic impact, peak hours, and the effect of festivals on delivery performance are explored. Advanced queries also include recursive date generation and predictive insights to support real-time decision-making.

The analysis aims to help delivery companies optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction, and identify bottlenecks in their delivery process.

## Business Problem

In the highly competitive food delivery industry, timely deliveries and high customer satisfaction are critical. Companies face challenges including:

- Delays due to traffic, weather, or vehicle conditions.
- Variations in delivery performance across cities and delivery personnel.
- Managing peak demand periods efficiently.
- Predicting late deliveries to proactively manage customer expectations.
- Understanding the impact of external factors like festivals and weather on delivery efficiency.

Addressing these issues helps reduce delivery time, improve customer ratings, and optimize resource allocation.

## Solution & Approach

To solve these problems, this project uses **SQL-based exploratory data analysis and predictive queries** on delivery datasets, focusing on:

- Tracking delivery ratings and performance over time.
- Comparing average delivery times across different cities, vehicle conditions, and traffic levels.
- Identifying popular order types and frequent delivery locations.
- Analyzing delivery delays during festivals and peak hours.
- Using recursive CTEs to generate complete daily delivery counts, even for days with no orders.
- Segmenting delivery times into buckets and categorizing traffic and weather conditions to predict late deliveries.
- Ranking delivery personnel by their efficiency and ratings to recognize top performers.

This data-driven approach helps businesses optimize delivery logistics, plan for high-demand periods, and enhance customer experience through improved operational insights.
